# Transformation

In non-drawing mode, you can perform transformation operations on elements in the canvas:

1. **Select Elements**
   - Click to select a single element
   - Hold Shift key to select multiple elements
   
2. **Transform Operations**
   - After selecting an element, a transform box will appear with 8 control points (4 corners and 4 midpoints of edges)
   - Drag these control points to change the size and shape of the element
   - Hold Shift key while dragging corner control points to maintain original proportions during scaling
   
3. **Rotation Operations**
   - There is a circular control point at the top of the transform box
   - Drag this point to rotate the element

These transformation operations help you precisely adjust the size, shape, and angle of elements, making design more flexible.
